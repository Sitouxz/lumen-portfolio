Target Users: Udine caters exclusively to students and dining staff within the campus environment. This focused approach ensures that feedback is relevant, actionable, and contributes directly to enhancing the quality of dining services.

### Problem:

The pre-registration process at Klabat University poses multifaceted challenges. Primarily, the absence of a user-friendly interface complicates the experience for students, leading to confusion and inaccuracies during the process. This leads to compromised data collection, causing faculty to grapple with scheduling woes such as full classes and overlapping schedules. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive pre-registration reports hampers faculty and administrative staff from acquiring vital insights, hindering effective support and services for students. The confluence of these issues necessitates an innovative solution to redefine the pre-registration landscape.

### Goals:

Our project is steadfast in its goal to revolutionize the class registration process at Unklab University. By introducing a user-friendly pre-registration interface, our focus is on enhancing the efficiency of the process, benefitting both faculty and students. Through data accuracy enhancements, we aim to eliminate scheduling issues, ensuring optimal class availability for all students. Moreover, our project targets bridging the information gap by delivering comprehensive pre-registration reports to faculty and administrative staff. Ultimately, our endeavor is to empower the Unklab Business School community with an efficient and streamlined pre-registration experience.

### Implementation:

Having successfully completed the development phase, our project is now fully operational and ready for deployment. The intuitive and interactive user interface we have crafted simplifies the pre-registration procedure, reducing confusion and inaccuracies. Through the integration of robust data validation mechanisms during development, we have enhanced data accuracy, effectively eliminating scheduling challenges. Furthermore, our solution delivers comprehensive pre-registration reports, equipping faculty and administrative staff with the insights required for effective decision-making.

As we transition from development to deployment, our focus shifts towards ensuring a seamless user experience. Regular maintenance, user training, and ongoing support mechanisms are in place to guarantee the continued efficiency of the pre-registration process. With the successful culmination of the development phase, our project stands poised to transform the pre-registration landscape, offering a frictionless academic journey for both students and staff at the Unklab Business School.
